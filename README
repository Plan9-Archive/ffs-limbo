# status

can read an openbsd ffs1 file system, needs more testing and better
interpretation of data structures (e.g. frag/block sizes).


# intro

ffs is a read-only implementation of the bsd ffs as used on openbsd.
it only works on little endian systems, and probably only those
with 32 bit pointers.


# install

install package "util" first.

ensure a "mkconfig" file is present.  a bind/symlink to the mkconfig
of your inferno install should do.  now "mk install" to compile and
install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- find better specification, for other bsd's too
- which should we use super.fragsize?  currently it seems we have to use super.fragsize in places where i expected to need super.blocksize.
- which fields are used for fragments?  we're currently always reading from start of block.
- think about little vs big endian (currently little endian only).  it seems 32 vs 64 bit pointers might matter too...
- ufs2 support?
- direntry entry hashing for faster lookups
- is disklabel endian-dependent too?
- more testing
